# Desk sheets for you to reference in your office space. 

Do you ever wake up and wish you were a badass hacker like Hugh Jackman in _Swordfish_?  Me too. 

I can't make you that, but I can bring you closer.  

Here are some reference sheets. They include hotkeys, descriptions, programming functions, and other meta things.

I've built an index of them in the attached [Office-space-cheat-sheet.xlsx](https://github.com/Dan-OSU/Office-space-reference-sheets/blob/main/Office-space-cheat-sheet.xlsx) file here in the home directory.

This file has pivot tables, slicers, and other nerdy things to Hugh your Jackman. Enjoy!
